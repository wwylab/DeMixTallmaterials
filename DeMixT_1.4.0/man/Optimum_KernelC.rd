\arguments{
\item{inputdata}{A matrix of expression data (e.g gene expressions) from
reference (e.g. normal) and mixed samples (e.g. mixed tumor samples). It is a
\eqn{G*M} matrix where \eqn{G} is the number of genes and \eqn{M} is the 
number of samples including reference and mixed samples. Samples with the 
same tissue type should be placed together in columns (e.g. cbind(normal
amples, mixed tumor samples).}

\item{groupid}{A vector of indicators to denote if the corresponding samples
are reference samples or mixed tumor samples. DeMixT is able to deconvolve
mixed tumor samples with at most three components. We use 1 and 2 to denote
the samples referencing the first and the second known component in mixed 
tumor samples. We use 3 to indicate mixed tumor samples prepared to be
deconvolved. For example, in two-component deconvolution, we have 
c(1,1,...,3,3) and in three-component deconvolution, we have 
c(1,1,...,2,2,...,3,3).}

\item{nspikein}{The number of spikes in normal reference used for proportion
estimation. The default value is \eqn{ min(200, 0.3*My)}, where 
\eqn{My} the number of mixed tumor samples. If it is set to 0, proportion 
estimation is performed without any spike in normal reference.}

\item{setting.pi}{If it is set to 0, then deconvolution is performed without 
any given proportions; if set to 1, deconvolution with given proportions 
for the first and the second known component is run; if set to 2, 
deconvolution is run with given tumor proportions. This option helps to 
perform deconvolution in different settings. In estimation of 
component-specific proportions, we use a subset of genes ; so when 
it is required to deconvolve another subset of genes, we just easily plug 
back our estimated proportions by setting this option to 1. In our two-step
estimation strategy in a three-component setting, this option is set to 2 to
implement the second step.}

\item{givenpi}{\eqn{ST}-Vector of proportions. Given the number of mixed
tumor samples is \eqn{My(My<M)}, \eqn{ST} is set to \eqn{2*My} in a
three-component setting and \eqn{My} in a two-component setting. When 
setting.pi is 1, it is fixed with the given proportions for the first and the
second known component of mixed tumor samples, or for one unknown 
component when there is just one type of reference tissues. It has the form 
of Vector \eqn{PiN1-1}, \eqn{PiN1-2}, ..., \eqn{PiN1-My}, \eqn{PiN2-1}, 
\eqn{PiN2-2}, ..., \eqn{PiN2-My}.}

\item{givenpiT}{\eqn{ST}-Vector of proportions. When setting.pi is set to 2,
givenpiT is fixed with given proportions for unknown component of mixed 
tumor samples. This option is used when we adopt a two-step estimation
strategy in deconvolution. It has the form of Vector  \eqn{PiT-1}, 
\eqn{PiT-2}, ..., \eqn{PiT-My}. If option is not 2, 
this vector can be given with any element.}

\item{niter}{The number of iterations used in the algorithm of iterated
conditional modes. A larger value can better guarantee the convergence 
in estimation but increase the computation time.}

\item{ninteg}{The number of bins used in numerical integration for computing
complete likelihood. A larger value can increase accuracy in estimation but
also increase the running time. Especially in three-component deconvolution,
the increase of number of bins can greatly lengthen the running time.}

\item{tol}{The convergence criterion. The default is 10^(-5).}

\item{sg0}{Initial value for \eqn{\sigma^2}. The default is 0.5^2.}

\item{mu0}{Initial value for \eqn{\mu}. The default is 0.}

\item{pi01}{Initialized proportion for first kown component. The default is 
\eqn{Null} and pi01 will be generated randomly from uniform distribution.}

\item{pi02}{Initialized proportion for second kown component. pi02 is needed 
only for running a three-component model. The default is \eqn{Null} and pi02 
will be generated randomly from uniform distribution.}

\item{nthread}{The number of threads used for deconvolution when OpenMP 
is available in the system. The default is the number of whole threads minus
one. In our no-OpenMP version, it is set to 1.}
}
\value{
\item{pi}{Matrix of estimated proportions for each known component. The first
row corresponds to the proportion estimate of each sample for the first known
component (groupid = 1) and the second row corresponds to that for the second
known component (groupid = 2).}
\item{decovExpr}{A matrix of deconvolved expression profiles corresponding to
unknown (e.g tumor) component in mixed samples for a given subset of genes.
Each row corresponds to one gene and each column corresponds to one sample.} 
\item{decovMu}{Estimated \eqn{Mu} of log2-normal distribution for tumor
component.}
\item{decovSigma}{Estimated \eqn{Sigma} of log2-normal distribution for 
tumor component.}
\item{pi1}{An \eqn{My*I} matrix of estimated proportions for each 
iteration, where \eqn{I} is the number of iteration, for the first 
known component.}
\item{pi2}{An \eqn{My*I} matrix of estimated proportions for each 
iteration, where \eqn{I} is the number of iteration, for the second 
known component.}
}
\description{
This function is invoked by DeMixT_GS or DeMixT_S1 and DeMixT_S2 to 
finish parameter estimation by iterated conditional mode algorithm and reconstitute
gene expression profile of all components.
