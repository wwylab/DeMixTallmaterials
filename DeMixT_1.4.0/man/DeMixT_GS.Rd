\arguments{
\item{data.Y}{A SummarizedExperiment object of expression data from mixed 
tumor samples. It is a \eqn{G} by \eqn{My} matrix where \eqn{G} is the number
of genes and \eqn{My} is the number of mixed samples. Samples with the same
tissue type should be placed together in columns.}

\item{data.N1}{A SummarizedExperiment object of expression data 
from reference component 1 (e.g., normal). It is a \eqn{G} by \eqn{M1} matrix 
where \eqn{G} is the number of genes and \eqn{M1} is the number of samples 
for component 1.}

\item{data.N2}{A SummarizedExperiment object of expression data from
additional reference samples. It is a \eqn{G} by \eqn{M2} matrix where 
\eqn{G} is the number of genes and \eqn{M2} is the number of samples for
component 2. Component 2 is needed only for running a three-component model.}

\item{niter}{The maximum number of iterations used in the algorithm of 
iterated conditional modes. A larger value better guarantees 
the convergence in estimation but increases the running time. The default is 
10.}

\item{nbin}{The number of bins used in numerical integration for computing
complete likelihood. A larger value increases accuracy in estimation but
increases the running time, especially in a three-component deconvolution
problem. The default is 50.}

\item{if.filter}{The logical flag indicating whether a predetermined filter
rule is used to select genes for proportion estimation. The default is TRUE.}

\item{filter.sd}{The cut-off for the standard deviation of lognormal 
distribution. Genes whose log transferred standard deviation smaller than
the cut-off will be selected into the model. The default is TRUE.}

\item{ngene.Profile.selected}{The number of genes used for proportion
estimation ranked by profile likelihood. The default is 
\eqn{min(1500,0.1*My)}, where \eqn{My} is the number of mixed samples.}

\item{ngene.selected.for.pi}{The percentage or the number of genes used for
proportion estimation. The difference between the expression levels from
mixed tumor samples and the known component(s) are evaluated, and the most
differential expressed genes are selected, which is called S1. It is enabled
when if.filter = TRUE. The default is \eqn{min(1500, 0.3*My)}, where
\eqn{My} is the number of mixed sample. Users can also try using more genes,
ranging from \eqn{0.3*My} to \eqn{0.5*My}, and evaluate the outcome.}

\item{mean.diff.in.CM}{Threshold of expression difference for selecting
genes in the component merging strategy. We merge three-component to 
two-component by selecting genes with similar expressions for the two known
components. Genes with the mean differences less than the threshold will 
be selected for component merging. It is used in the three-component 
setting, and is enabled when if.filter = TRUE. The default is 0.25.}

\item{nspikein}{The number of spikes in normal reference used for proportion
estimation. The default value is \eqn{ min(200, 0.3*My)}, where 
\eqn{My} the number of mixed samples. If it is set to 0, proportion 
estimation is performed without any spike in normal reference.}

\item{tol}{The convergence criterion. The default is 10^(-5).}

\item{pi01}{Initialized proportion for first kown component. The default is 
\eqn{Null} and pi01 will be generated randomly from uniform distribution.}

\item{pi02}{Initialized proportion for second kown component. pi02 is needed 
only for running a three-component model. The default is \eqn{Null} and pi02 
will be generated randomly from uniform distribution.}

\item{nthread}{The number of threads used for deconvolution when OpenMP 
is available in the system. The default is the number of whole threads
minus one. In our no-OpenMP version, it is set to 1.}
}
\value{
\item{pi}{A matrix of estimated proportion. First row and second row 
corresponds to the proportion estimate for the known components and unkown 
component respectively for two or three component settings, and each column 
corresponds to one sample.}
\item{pi.iter}{Estimated proportions in each iteration. It is a \eqn{niter 
*My*p} array, where \eqn{p} is the number of components. This is 
enabled only when output.more.info = TRUE.}
\item{gene.name}{The names of genes used in estimating the proportions. 
If no gene names are provided in the original data set, the genes will
be automatically indexed.}

\description{
This function is designed to estimate the proportions of all 
mixed samples for each mixing component with a new proposed profile likelihood 
based gene selection, which can select most identifiable genes as reference 
gene sets to achieve better model fitting quality. We first calculated the
Hessian matrix of the parameter spaces and then derive the confidence interval 
of the profile likelihood of each gene. We then utilized the length of 
confidence interval as a metric to rank the identifiability of genes. As 
a result, the proposed gene selection approach can improve the tumor-specific 
transcripts proportion estimation.
}
\note{
A Hessian matrix file will be created in the working directory and the
corresponding Hessian matrix with an encoded name from the mixed tumor
sample data will be saved under this file. If a user reruns this function 
with the same dataset, this Hessian matrix will be loaded to in place of 
running the profile likelihood method and reduce running time.
