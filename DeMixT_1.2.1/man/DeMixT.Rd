\title{Deconvolution of heterogeneous tumor samples with two or three 
components using expression data from RNAseq or microarray platforms}

\description{DeMixT is a software that performs deconvolution on transcriptome
data from a mixture of two or three components.}

\usage{
DeMixT(data.Y, data.comp1, data.comp2 = NULL, niter = 10, nbin = 50, 
if.filter = TRUE, ngene.selected.for.pi = 250, mean.diff.in.CM = 0.25, 
tol = 10^(-5), output.more.info = FALSE, 
nthread = parallel::detectCores() - 1)
}

\arguments{
\item{data.Y}{A SummarizedExperiment object of expression data from mixed
tumor samples. It is a \eqn{G} by \eqn{Sy} matrix where \eqn{G} is the number
of genes and \eqn{Sy} is the number of mixed samples. Samples with the same
tissue type should be placed together in columns.}

\item{data.comp1}{A SummarizedExperiment object of expression data from
reference component 1 (e.g., normal). It is a \eqn{G} by \eqn{S1} matrix 
where \eqn{G} is the number of genes and \eqn{S1} is the number of samples 
for component 1. }

\item{data.comp2}{A SummarizedExperiment object of expression data from
additional reference samples. It is a \eqn{G} by \eqn{S2} matrix where 
\eqn{G} is the number of genes and \eqn{S2} is the number of samples for
component 2. Component 2 is needed only for running a three-component model.}

\item{niter}{The maximum number of iterations used in the algorithm of 
iterated conditional modes (ICM, Ref[1]). A larger value better guarantees 
the convergence in estimation but increases the running time. The default is 
10.}

\item{nbin}{The number of bins used in numerical integration for computing
complete likelihood. A larger value increases accuracy in estimation but
increases the running time, especially in a three-component deconvolution
problem. The default is 50.}

\item{if.filter}{The logical flag indicating whether a predetermined filter
rule is used to select genes for proportion estimation. The default is TRUE.}

\item{ngene.selected.for.pi}{The percentage or the number of genes used for
proportion estimation. The difference between the expression levels from
mixted tumor samples and the known component(s) are evaluated, and the most
differentially expressed genes are selected. 
It is enabled when if.filter = TRUE. The default is 250.}

\item{mean.diff.in.CM}{Threshold of expression difference in selecting genes
in the component merging strategy. We merge three-component to two-component
by selecting genes with similar expressions for the two known components.
Genes with the mean differences less than the threshold will be selected for
component merging. It is used in the three-component setting, and is enabled
when if.filter = TRUE. The default is 0.25.}

\item{tol}{The convergence criterion. The default is 10^(-5).}

\item{output.more.info}{The logical flag indicating whether to show the
estimated proportions in each iteration in the output.}

\item{nthread}{The number of threads used for deconvolution when OpenMP is
availble in the system. The default is the number of whole threads minus one.
In our no-OpenMP version, it is set to 1.}
}

\value{
\item{pi}{Matrix of estimated proportions for each known component.
\eqn{\pi1} corresponds to the proportion estimate for the first known
component. \eqn{\pi2} corresponds to the second known component.} 

\item{pi.iter}{Estimated proportions in each iteration. It is a \eqn{number of
iteration X Sy X 1} array in two-component setting, and a 
\eqn{number_of_iteration X Sy X 2} array in three-component setting. 
This is enabled only when output.more.info = TRUE.}

\item{ExprT}{Matrix of deconvolved expression profiles corresponding to 
T-component in mixed samples for a given subset of genes. Each row 
corresponds to one gene and each column corresponds to one sample.}  

\item{ExprN1}{Matrix of deconvolved expression profiles corresponding to 
N1-component in mixed samples for a given subset of genes. Each row 
corresponds to one gene and each column corresponds to one sample.} 

\item{ExprN2}{Matrix of deconvolved expression profiles corresponding to 
N2-component in mixed samples for a given subset of genes in a 
three-component setting. Each row corresponds to one gene and each 
column corresponds to one sample.} 

\item{Mu}{Estimated \eqn{\mu} of log2-normal distribution for both known
(\eqn{MuN1, MuN2}) and unknown component (\eqn{MuT}).}

\item{Sigma}{Estimated \eqn{\sigma} of log2-normal distribution for both 
known (\eqn{SigmaN1, SigmaN2}) and unknown component (\eqn{SigmaT}).}

\item{gene.name}{The names of genes used in estimating the proportions. 
If no gene names are rpovided in the original data set, the genes will be
automatically indexed. This is enabled only when output.more.info = TRUE.}
