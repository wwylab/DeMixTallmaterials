\title{Simulated three-component mixed cell line test data}
\format{An object of class \code{list} of length 6.}
\usage{
test.data.3comp
}
\value{
A list with 6 elements (3 more elements when output.more.info = 
TRUE), which are
\item{pi}{A matrix of estimated proportion. First row and second row 
corresponds to the proportion estimate for the known components and unkown 
component respectively for two or three component settings. Each column 
corresponds to one sample.}
\item{Mu}{Simulated \eqn{Mu} of log2-normal distribution for both known
(\eqn{MuN1, MuN2}) and unknown component (\eqn{MuT}).}
\item{Sigma}{Simulated \eqn{Sigma} of log2-normal distribution for both 
known (\eqn{SigmaN1, SigmaN2}) and unknown component
 (\eqn{SigmaT}).}
\item{data.Y}{A SummarizedExperiment object of simulated expression data 
from mixed tumor samples. It is a \eqn{G} by \eqn{My} matrix where \eqn{G}
is the number of genes and \eqn{My} is the number of mixed samples. 
Samples with the same tissue type should be placed together in columns.}
\item{data.N1}{A SummarizedExperiment object of simulated expression data 
from reference component 1 (e.g., normal). It is a \eqn{G} by \eqn{M1} matrix 
where \eqn{G} is the number of genes and \eqn{M1} is the number of samples 
for component 1.}
\item{data.N2}{A SummarizedExperiment object of expression data from
additional reference samples. It is a \eqn{G} by \eqn{M2} matrix where 
\eqn{G} is the number of genes and \eqn{M2} is the number of samples for
component 2.}
\item{True.data.T}{A SummarizedExperiment object of simulated tumor expression 
data. It is a \eqn{G} by \eqn{My} matrix, where \eqn{G} is the number of 
genes and \eqn{My} is the number of mixed samples.This is shown only when 
output.more.info = TRUE.}
\item{True.data.N1}{A SummarizedExperiment object of simulated true 
expression data for reference component 1 (e.g., stroma). It is a \eqn{G} 
by \eqn{M1} matrix where \eqn{G} is the number of genes and \eqn{M1} is the 
number of samples for component 1. This is shown only when 
output.more.info = TRUE.}
\item{True.data.N2}{A SummarizedExperiment object of simulated true 
expression data for reference component 2 (e.g., immue). It is a \eqn{G} 
by \eqn{M2} matrix where \eqn{G} is the number of genes and \eqn{M2} is the 
number of samples for component 2. This is shown only when 
output.more.info = TRUE.}
}
\description{
A list of simulated three-component mixed cell line
test data used in DeMixT function. Expression data with 700 genes 
and 20 samples are simulated, where 675 genes' \eqn{MuN1} is close 
to \eqn{MuN2}.
